# SMA Strategy Backtest ðŸ“ˆ

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Finance.ipynb`) that tests a **Simple Moving Average (SMA) long-bias strategy** on selected U.S. stocks.  
The strategy enters a long position when the stockâ€™s price is above its SMA and exits to cash when below.

## ðŸŒ± Motivation

This project was started out of my interest in both **finance** and **technology**.  
I wanted to understand how quantitative strategies are built and evaluated, while also sharpening my programming and data analysis skills.  

By applying a moving average strategy to real stock data, I was able to:
- Explore financial concepts like **trend following, cumulative returns, and drawdowns**.  
- Gain hands-on practice in **Python, pandas, NumPy and data-driven backtesting**.  
- Bridge two worlds Iâ€™m passionate about: **markets and coding**.  

This notebook is a first step in learning how systematic strategies are researched and tested.
